# Habit-Tracker
Habit tracker made in python using the pixela API which shows the users progress in the form of a graph with pixels.
The settings such as the pixel colours, username, token, etc. can be changed according to the user's preferences in "main.py". The code is currently being used to track how many hours you spent at the gym but it can also be used to track various other things such as how many pages of a book you read or how many kilometers you cycle in a day just by changing the input text and a few other variables.
